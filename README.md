# Cisco CloudCenter Vagrant Plugin - Proof of Concept

This is a Vagrant plugin that adds a Cisco CloudCenter provider to Vagrant. It allows Vagrant to communicate with CloudCenter and have it control and provision machines in a number of public and private clouds. 

This plugin is currently a Proof of Concept and has been developed and tested against Cisco CloudCenter 4.6.0 and Vagrant 1.2+

## Features

* Boot instances thorugh CloudCenter
* SSH into the instances
* Provision the instances with any built-in Vagrant provisioner
* Minimal synced folder support via `rsync`

## Usage

After installing the plugin use the `vagrant up` command an specify the `cloudcenter`  provider.

```
$ vagrant up --provider=cloudcenter
...
```

The following additional plugin commands have been provided:

* `vagrant cloudcenter init` - Create a template Vagrantfile and populate with your own configuration
* `vagrant cloudcenter catalog` - Return a list of the current available catalog 
* `vagrant cloudcenter jobs` - Return a list of service requests and their current status

## Vagrantfile structure 

You can either manually create a Vagrantfile that looks like the following, filling in
your information where necessary, or run the `vagrant cloudcenter init` command to have an empty Vagrantfile created for you.

```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|

	config.vm.box = 'cloudcenter'
 
	config.vm.provider :cloudcenter do |cloudcenter|
		cloudcenter.username = 'my_username'
		cloudcenter.access_key = 'my_access_key'
		cloudcenter.host_ip = 'cloudcenter_host_ip_address'
		cloudcenter.deployment_config = 'sample_deployment_config.json'
	end
  
  	config.vm.synced_folder '.', '/opt/my_files/', type: 'rsync'

end
```

## Installation

## Box Format

## Configuration

This provider exposes quite a few provider-specific configuration options:

* `access_key` - The access key for accessing the Cisco CloudCenter API
* `username` - The username for accessing the  CloudCenter API
* `host_ip` - The host IP address of the CloudCenter Manager
* `deployment_config` - A JSON file used by CloudCenter to deploy the desired infrastructure

## Synced Folders

There is minimal support for synced folders. Upon `vagrant up`,
`vagrant reload`, and `vagrant provision`, the CloudCenter provider will use
`rsync` (if available) to uni-directionally sync the folder to
the remote machine over SSH.

See [Vagrant Synced folders: rsync](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/rsync.html)

## Development

To work on the CloudCenter plugin, clone this repository then run the following commands to build and install the plugin.

```
$ gem build vagrant-cloudcenter.gemspec
$ vagrant plugin install ./vagrant-cloudcenter-0.1.0.gem
```

To uninstall the plugin run `vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-cloudcenter`
